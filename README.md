# Code-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

 My motivation for this project was to make this webpage more accessible and **functional** by adding, **Semantic Structure** to HTML/CSS and **alt** attributes to anything that may be relevent such as images. I changed the order of the CSS and simplified the code by disposing of any duplicated selectors with the same content, and also added **alt** attributes to images that required a description to add **accessability** to the site for anybody that may be using screen readers. This project taught me a'lot about how HTML should and can be structured to make it easier for yourself and others to read, and lastly I started playing around with **@media** queries to make it more funtional for the Ipad Pro, but this was just test more to this will be explained in
