## Description

 My motivation for this project was to make this webpage more accessible and **functional** by adding, **Semantic Structure** to HTML/CSS and **alt** attributes to anything that may be relevent such as images. I changed the order of the CSS and simplified the code by disposing of any duplicated selectors with the same content, and also added **alt** attributes to images that required a description to add **accessability** to the site for anybody that may be using screen readers. This project taught me a'lot about how HTML should and can be structured to make it easier for yourself and others to read, and lastly I started playing around with **@media** queries to make it more funtional for the Ipad Pro, but this was just test more to this will be explained in 
 [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

Link for the website is located here <a href="https://kaleims.github.io/Code-Refactor-Challenge/" target="_blank">here</a>. **Recommended Brower** would be Chrome as the Ipad Pro can be tested for functionality. Firstly you want to right click anywhere on the webpage and select **inspect element**. To test out the Ipad Pro funtionality you will need to remove the comments for the media queries located in the style.css file, the first image below shows the location of the CSS file at the top right of the first screenshot. Remove Line 165 and 199 in the style.css file which is located in assets/css folder. Last set of instructions are at the bottom of the **Usage** section.

<img src="assets/images/How-To.PNG" alt="image" width="700" height="auto">

Refer to the **picture** above. Right click anywhere on the webpage and select inspect element, then refer to the image above and click where the number **1** is located this will open the device tool. And then refer to the image above and click where the number **2** is to open a dropdown box and select **Ipad Pro**. Once you do this, the page will show what it would look like on an Ipad Pro. **Refresh** the page to revert any changes made.
